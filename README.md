# Summary
This short tutorial for software testing is an extra-credit mini-project I
made for my Programming Practicum class: CS 211 at UIC (which is supposed to
teach software engineering practices and tools). I thought it was necessary to
include some sort of material on software testing (since it's so crucial to
software engineering outside of academia-land), and I hope it helps people
get started with software testing.

# TODO
 - Look at testing for Java:
    - JUnit (popular, possibly more common in industry)
    - Cucumber (has cool name. Also, all the cool kids use it)
